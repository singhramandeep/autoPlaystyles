/*
 * PlayStyle Evo Helper — batch-apply PlayStyle / PlayStyle+ evolutions to one player.
 *
 * Install: Tampermonkey → new script → paste this file → save. Open the EA FC 26
 * web app, go to the Evolutions (Academy) hub. A floating panel appears.
 * Usage: search a player (search defaults to evo-eligible rarities), pick a
 * Position+Role and hit ✨ Suggest (or tick evos by hand), then Apply selected.
 *
 * ⚠ Automating the FC web app is against EA's Terms of Service and can get your
 * account banned. Use at your own risk.
 *
 * How it works: drives the web app's OWN service objects (state-safe), not raw HTTP.
 *   services.Academy.addItemToSlot(slotId, itemId)  -> apply an evo
 *   services.Academy.claimSlot(slotId)              -> claim/finish it
 *   repositories.Item.getClub().items               -> club players
 * PlayStyle traitId = rewardId - 301. Caps: 3 PS+ / 8 basic per player.
 * Console helpers on window.FCEvo: scrapeRarities(), clubRaritiesDump(),
 * eligibleRarities(slotId).
